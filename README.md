**About**

A collection of scripts to ease the installation of Docker, Docker Compose and various containers on your Ubuntu host.

**General Requirements**

A fully updated Ubuntu 18.04 machine. It's possible most if not all will work on newer versions of Ubuntu but we haven't tested. Some feedback would certainly be helpful.

**Quick script install and run instructions**

Git clone the Docker repository:

`sudo git clone https://github.com/deeztek/deeztek-docker.git`

This will clone the repository and create a deeztek-docker directory in the directory you ran the git clone command from.

Change to the portainer directory:

`cd deeztek-docker/Linux/`

Run the following script as root:

`sudo bash start.sh`
